# 🚀 Chapter 4: Conditional Statements – Making Smart Decisions!

Welcome to Chapter 4! Now that you know how to work with variables, data types, and operators, it's time to make your programs *think* and *decide*! 🧠💡

Conditional statements help Python make decisions based on conditions. Think of them as road signs that guide your program based on different situations.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn:
✅ How to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements  
✅ Writing conditions using comparison and logical operators  
✅ Nested conditions for advanced decision-making  
✅ Using conditions with user input

## 🛣️ **The If Statement – Making Choices**
Imagine a self-driving car that stops at a red light. The car *checks* the light’s color before deciding whether to stop or go.

In Python, we use `if` statements to perform similar checks.

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult!")
```

🔹 **How it Works:**  
1. Python checks if `age >= 18`  
2. If `True`, it prints `"You are an adult!"`  
3. If `False`, nothing happens  

---

## 🌟 **If-Else: Handling Two Cases**
What if someone is under 18? Use `else` to provide an alternative action.

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote!")
else:
    print("Sorry, you are too young to vote.")
```

🔹 **Explanation:**  
- If the condition (`age >= 18`) is met, `"You can vote!"` is printed  
- Otherwise, the `else` block runs, printing `"Sorry, you are too young to vote."`  

---

## 🔄 **Elif – Multiple Conditions**
Sometimes, decisions have more than two options. `elif` (short for *else if*) lets you check multiple conditions.

```python
temperature = int(input("Enter the temperature: "))

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot! Drink water. 💧")
elif temperature > 20:
    print("The weather is pleasant. 😊")
elif temperature > 10:
    print("It's getting chilly! ❄️")
else:
    print("Brrr! It's freezing! 🥶")
```

🔹 **How it Works:**  
- The first `if` checks if `temperature > 30`  
- If `False`, the program moves to the next `elif`  
- If none of the `if` or `elif` conditions are met, the `else` block runs  

---

## 🔁 **Nested If – Conditions Inside Conditions**
You can have an `if` statement inside another `if`.

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
    if age >= 21:
        print("You can also drink alcohol (if legal in your country).")
    else:
        print("But you can't drink alcohol yet.")
else:
    print("You are underage.")
```

🔹 **Why Use Nested If?**  
- Allows more precise decision-making  
- Useful for complex scenarios  

---

## 🎭 **Logical Operators with Conditions**
Use `and`, `or`, and `not` to combine conditions.

```python
has_id = True
age = 20

if age >= 18 and has_id:
    print("You can enter the club! 🎉")
else:
    print("Sorry, you can't enter. 🚫")
```

🔹 **Logical Operators Recap:**  
- `and` → Both conditions must be `True`  
- `or` → At least one condition must be `True`  
- `not` → Reverses the condition  

---

## 📝 **Quick Recap**
✅ `if`, `elif`, and `else` help in decision-making  
✅ Conditions are checked using comparison (`>`, `<`, `==`, etc.)  
✅ Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) refine conditions  
✅ Nested `if` statements allow advanced checks
